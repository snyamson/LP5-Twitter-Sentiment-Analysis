## Introduction

The COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Analyzer project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models, including DistilBERT and RoBERTa, to systematically analyze and categorize sentiments expressed in a vast collection of COVID-19-related tweets. The project includes a Gradio app for interactive sentiment analysis and datasets for training and testing.
